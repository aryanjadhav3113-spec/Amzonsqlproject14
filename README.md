This SQL program creates an **AJshop database** with tables for customers, products, and orders. It adds sample data, creates indexes for faster searches, and uses **JOIN**, **BETWEEN**, and **EXISTS** queries to find order and product details. The **EXPLAIN** command checks query performance for better optimization and speed.
